        <div class="subheading mb-5">Education MajorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am Mark Lee, a 4th year Education Major at the University of California, Riverside.  I grew up in the United States, mostly staying in California.  I spent a year in Chicago, Illinois due to my father's work situation.  I was raised on the simple moral that hard work will eventually pay off.  The pain of studying will only be temporary, but the pain of not studying lasts a lifetime.  I had an older brother that set a model example of what I should strive to be, and I have always tried to mimic that example.  While I  went down a different path than him, I still try to use what he taught me in my academic life.  Now twenty one years old, I am fast approaching the expected age where one should get a job and become a functioning member of society.  I have many experiences in my life that I believe would make me a good functioning member of any organization.<br><br>

        In High School, I made sure to set myself up for success in as many ways possible.  I made sure to stay on top of my grades, but also not to overwork myself.  I always knew of the risks of taking on more than I was capable of, and took reasonable amounts of difficult classes.  I pushed myself to excel in those classes and to try to rise high enough in academics to be allowed entry into honors and AP classes.  My GPA reflected this, never falling below 3.75, while garnering enough credit to be accepted into UCR.  I also tried to find other subjects and clubs that reflected my interests.  I joined the Speech-and-debate club and entered in multiple tournaments, where I participated in a variety of events; from Lincoln-Douglas to Public Forum.  I joined the Cross Country and Track-and-Field teams, and even became captain of the Cross Country team and the long distance track team.  Those experiences taught me leadership and persistence.<br><br>

        College was the first time I truly left the nest, and I learned a lot about self-reliance and agency in my years as an education major.  College is not at all like High School in that all responsibility is put onto the students, which means I could not afford to sit back and let opportunities pass me by.  I made sure to make connections, talking to professors, TAâ€™s and other students of all years and majors.  This gave me plenty of social activity as well as expanding my basic knowledge of how the campus operated.  Continuing my desire for physical activity, I joined the Dragon Boat team, Riverside Surging Dragons.  My major, education, is preparing me for a life in the educational field.  I hope to use what I learned in the past four years to help guide high school kids into the right college to achieve their ambitions.  Since that was an uncertain period in my life, I hope to make it a little more bearable for others to come.
